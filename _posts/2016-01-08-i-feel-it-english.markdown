### I feel it! 

sentir is a verb of "to feel"

So to say "I fell" you say "siento" (conjugation)

### When to say "it" 

it = 'lo' 

But you say "it" before, not afters

So to say

"I fell it" - you say "lo siento"

### I'm sorry

When someone in Spanish says "I fell it", what they are realy saying is "I'm sorry"


### how would you say

"I'm sorry, but its not acceptable for me"
