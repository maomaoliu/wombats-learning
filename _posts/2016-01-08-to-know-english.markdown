### We spoke about some verbs

necesitar  - to need

necesito  - I need

tener - to have

tengo - I have

querar  - To Want

quiero - I want


### To know (general knowledge)

saber - to know  (general knowledge)

se - I know

### Multiple words
When verbs are together, the second (and third verbs) together are in 'the two form'

SO to say, I need to have it - you say

lo necesito tener

### How would you say

I want to know

I dont know 

I dont know it


Qsentir is a verb of "to feel"

So to say "I fell" you say "siento" (conjugation)

### When to say "it" 

it = 'lo' 

But you say "it" before, not after

So to say

"I fell it" - you say "lo siento"

### I'm sorry

When someone in Spanish says "I fell it", what they are really saying is "I'm sorry"


### how would you say

"I'm sorry, but its not acceptable for me"
