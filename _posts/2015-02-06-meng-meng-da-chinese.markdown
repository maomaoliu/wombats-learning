### 萌萌哒  méng méng dā   

-----------

萌: adj. Cute, Lovely

哒: an auxiliary word and means nothing. Actually it is "的", but this word "哒" looks more cute than "的".


Example:
	
 # When you want to express something or somebody really cute, 
you can use this phrase.
	 
	- I feel myself 萌萌哒 today because I wear a really cute T-shirt.
	- 你 nǐ (You) 好 hǎo (are very) 萌 méng (cute).
