(Sometimes spelt "ether")

A imaginary invisible material that the ancient Greeks believed filled the universe. They called it "the fifth element" (earth, air, fire, water, aether). The word is now used to describe something that is invisible, intangible, and impossible to find.

"It disappeared into the aether"
