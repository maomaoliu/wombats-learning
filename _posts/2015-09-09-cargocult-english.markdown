### noun [ˈkɑr goʊ kʌlt]
-----------

A practice where people do something without really understanding why, because they saw someone successful doing it and wanted to be successful themselves. For example, entrepreneurs wearing black skivvies because that's what Steve Jobs did.

This meaning came from the behavior of several pacific island tribes who had encountered soldiers during World War Two. They noticed that soldiers often received air drops of valuable 'cargo', including nice clothes, food and vehicles. When the soldiers left at the end of the war, many of the indiginous tribes started cults which mimicked the behavior of those soldiers, hoping that they would start to receive air dropped cargo too. This included dressing in military-looking clothes, performing marching drills with pretend guns they made out of wood, wearing headphones they made out of coconuts, and building a life-sized model aircraft on an abandoned landing strip using twigs and leaves.

In IT, cargo culting happens when you see something that a successful company does, then try to do exactly the same thing without actually understanding _why_ that behaviour worked for that company.
