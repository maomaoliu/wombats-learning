### Summary to date:
it is = "es"

ible = ible

able = able

Possible =  posible

Probable = probable


### For example:

It is possible  = es posible

It is not probable = no es probable


###  For me, for you

For me = "para me"

For you = "para usted"


## New words

### Like That or That Way

asi 

### Why

por que


### You should now be able to say

It is that way

It is not possible that way

Why isnt it acceptable for you that way?
