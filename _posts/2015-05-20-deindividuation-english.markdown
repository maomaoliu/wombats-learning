### noun 
-----------

Deindividuation is based on the word "individual".  

The "de" means the opposite - so "anti individual" 

The "ation" in the word means "an action or instance".

So working that through, it is "The instance of anti individauls".

Deindividuation is a concept in social psychology that is generally thought of as the loss of self-awareness in groups.

Generally, being an 'internet bully' or 'riotor' comes from the deindividuation of something or somebody.
